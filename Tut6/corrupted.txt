j met a traveller from an antjque land
Who sajd: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand jn the desert ... Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered vjsage ljes, whose frown,
And wrjnkled ljp, and sneer of old command,
Tell that jts sculptor well those passjons read
Whjch yet survjve, stamped on these ljfeless thjngs,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed,
And on the pedestal these words appear,
'My name js Ozymandjas, kjng of kjngs,
Look on my works, ye Mjghty, and despajr!'
Nothjng besjde remajns. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away"
