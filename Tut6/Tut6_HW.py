# HW Question:
'''
Again, You have been provided with a file. But this time, due to some error, 
every character
'i' has been mistakenly written as 'j'.
(This question will be provided as a task to the students, 
no solution as such would be provided
for it)
- Replace those 'j's with 'i'.
- Create another file and copy the contents of the file(after correcting all 'j's to 'i'),
but with a twist. This time, Everything should be in UPPERCASE, in the new file.
